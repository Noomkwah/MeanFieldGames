This project is part of a course taken in my last year of financial engineering studies, about Partial Differential Equations (PDE) in finance. I successfully carried out this project alongside Alexandre Alouadi.
It deals with Mean Field Games, and explores how one can model a simple version of these games via a Forward-Backward PDE system.

We first introduce the objective and the controlled diffusion the underlying process follows. The goal is to find a best control $u$ and a flow of density probabilities $m$ that satisfies a system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations. The HJB equation is supplemented with a terminal condition and the KFP equation is supplemented with an initial condition. The main intricacy of this project dwells in this forward / backward duality. The system is solved using Picard Fixed Points iterations.
